#📝 Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to track:

-Cases & Deaths (daily trends, country-wise comparisons)

-Vaccination Progress (rollout speed, coverage)

-Death Rates & Case Fatality

-Geographical Distribution (choropleth maps)

Built with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it provides interactive visualizations and data-driven insights.



✨ Features
✅ Data Cleaning – Handles missing values, filters key metrics
✅ Time-Series Analysis – Tracks cases, deaths, vaccinations
✅ Country Comparison – Compares metrics across regions
✅ Visualizations – Line charts, bar plots, choropleth maps
✅ Insights Generation – Summarizes key trends
